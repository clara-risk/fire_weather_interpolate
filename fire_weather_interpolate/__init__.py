fire_weather_interpolate
======

Summary
--------

Code for spatially interpolating weather data and also for calculating the
Canadian fire weather index (FWI) metrics. Includes code for comparison and
evaluation of accuracy (cross-validation).

get_data: contains functions to extract the weather data (and data from
lookup files, such as for slope) from the files provided with the code.

idw: has functions to interpolate using IDW interpolation and to cross-validate 
for each weather station.

tps: has functions to interpolate using thin plate (smoothing) splines and
to cross-validate. 

idew: has functions to interpolate using IDEW interpolation and to
cross-validate. 

ok: has functions to interpolate using ordinary kriging and to cross-validate.

rf: has functions to interpolate using random forest and to cross-validate. 

fwi: has functions to calculate the FWI metrics and do procedures such as
calculating the station start-up date and overwintering the drought code.

Eval: has functions for evaluating the strength of the relationship with 
area burned and also for evaluating the leave-one-out cross validation 
(i.e., RMSE calculation).
